# Simple Markdown Website

A barebones personal website with zero frameworks - just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to the `simple-site/` directory
2. Run a local web server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. Open http://localhost:8000

## What's Inside

- **index.html** - Single HTML file with all code
- **content/** - Your markdown files (home.md, about.md, blog.md)

## Customization

Edit the markdown files in `content/` to change your content.
Edit the CSS in `index.html` to change colors and styling.

See `simple-site/README.md` for full documentation.
