## This is testing, and isn't complete

#### why shop quicky? 
I hate grocery shoppping.

#### So what's the quickest way to shop? 
Use a home delivery app like [glovo](https://glovoapp.com/), [Uber Eats](https://www.ubereats), or [deliveroo](https://deliveroo.co.uk) for the brits.
This is the fastest option, you manage to avoid the hassle of going to the store, finding you ingredients, waiting in line and then taking the groceries home. However I wanted to write this post for people who don't have the luxury to be able to use one of these services (wether it be inaccesibilty, being priced out ...)

I wanted to share the formula I've developed to make sure that all my shopping is under 40 minutes a week, alowing me to have more time for the things that *really* matter. 





I want to test that this works, here is a photo
