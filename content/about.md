### Who am I?
My name is Lukas. I've decided to format this page as a collection of lists so you can quickly get an idea of who I am without needing to read lengthy paragraphs.

Currently, I'm involved in a few activities:
* I organize [Altruisme Efectiu UAB](https://sites.google.com/view/altruisme-efectiu-uab/home).
* I (part-time) organize [AI Safety Barcelona](https://www.aisafetybcn.org).
* Conducting research to build a [screwworm-free future](https://screwworm.org) ðŸª°.
* (Slowly) trying to write a paper about population genetics with [Prof. Antonio Barbadilla](https://ibb.uab.cat/wp-content/themes/viral/modules/ibb_membres/view_membre.php?CodiMembre=224).
* In a personal capacity, I'm writing about normative and meta-ethics.
* \+ university degrees ðŸ˜›.

If you're viewing this website as part of an application process (internship, job application, grant, etc.), the information below may not be very relevant. I recommend checking out my CV on the landing page.

### Hobbies
* Reading ([here]() is a list of the things I'm reading).
* Learning new things ([MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu), my university's library, and [CrashCourse](https://thecrashcourse.com) are invaluable here).
* (Vegan) cooking.
* Calisthenics.

### Things I want to learn/read about
These are things I haven't learned yet (either because they weren't taught in school or I haven't gotten to them myself yet):
* Linear algebra.
* Bayesian statistics.
* Non-naturalist arguments for ethical realism.
* Type A vs. Type B physicalism of mind.
* The semiconductor industry.

## How I try to live my days
People often say, "How you live your day is how you live your life." Here are the ideas I try to incorporate into my actions:
* Deliberateness.
* [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism).
* Hard work.
* Mindfulness.
* [Jian Ai](https://www.britannica.com/topic/jianai) (å…¼çˆ±) / impartiality.
    * I understand that the two are similar (though I might be wrong).
