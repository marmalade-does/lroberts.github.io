### Who am I?
My Name is Lukas. [Here](face_profile.jpg) is a photo of me. I've decided to format this page as a collection of lists so you can quickly get an idea of who I am without needing to read through lengthy paragraphs.

Currently I'm doing a few things:
* I organise [Altruisme Efectiu UAB](https://sites.google.com/view/altruisme-efectiu-uab/home) 
* I (part-time) organise [AI Safety Barcelona](https://www.aisafetybcn.org)
* Doing research to build a [Screwworm free future](https://screwworm.org) ðŸª°
* (Slowly) trying to write a paper about population genetics with [Prof. Antonio Barbadilla](https://ibb.uab.cat/wp-content/themes/viral/modules/ibb_membres/view_membre.php?CodiMembre=224)
* In a personal capacity I'm writing about normative and meta-ethics. 
* \+ uni degrees ðŸ˜›
