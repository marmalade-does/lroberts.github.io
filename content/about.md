### Who am I?
My Name is Lukas. [Here](uploads/face_profile.jpg) is a photo of me. I've decided to format this page as a collection of lists so you can quickly get an idea of who I am without needing to read through lengthy paragraphs.

If you're viewing my website as part of an application process (internship, job application, grant, etc.), the information below may not be very relevant. I recommend checking out my CV instead: [here](uploads/resume.pdf).

### Hobbies
* Reading ([here]() is a list of the things I'm reading)
* Learning new things. ([MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu), my uni's librairy and [Crash course](https://thecrashcourse.com) are invaluable here)
* (Vegan) cooking.
* Calinthenics 

### Thing I want to learn/read about
These are things that I havn't learn't yet (because either not taught in school or haven't gotten to learning it myself yet)
* Linear algebra
* Bayesian statistics
* Arguments for normative realism
* Late Imperial chinese history (especially relating to historical trends in economic growth)
* Type A vs Type B physicalism of mind.
* The semi-conductor industry.

## How I try live my days
People often say "how you live your day is how you live your life". Here are the ideas I try to incorporate into how I act.
* Deliberatness
* [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism)
* Hard work
* Mindfulness
* [Jian Ai](https://www.britannica.com/topic/jianai) (兼爱) / impartiality
    * I understand that the two are similair (might be wrong though)
