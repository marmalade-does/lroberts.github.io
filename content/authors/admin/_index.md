Iâ€™m doing a degree in genetics and another in informatics. Iâ€™m particularly interested in exploring the intersection of data science and molecular biology. Iâ€™m fascinated by innovative approaches to solving complex biological problems, especially the application of machine learning.

Outside of my academic studies, Iâ€™m a strong believer in life-long learning. Recently, Iâ€™ve been diving into subjects like normative ethics, epistemics, AI, and global health. Iâ€™m also the founder and president of [Altruisme Efectiu UAB](https://sites.google.com/view/altruisme-efectiu-uab/home)
