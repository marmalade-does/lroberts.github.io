People sometimes ask me about the software, tools, and stuff that I use. The idea of this "uses" page is to provide a reference where you can read about all the things I use in my life.

### This website

- I used [Hugo Blox](https://hugoblox.com) to create this website. It's a free, open-source website builder based on Markdown/HTML with some YAML. It's built on the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator.

## Editor + Terminal

- [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com) is my main browser. It's quite large/heavy, but it has so many features... ðŸ˜–
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my current editor. However, I use VIM on my Ubuntu virtual machine. (I need to change this...)
- [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/es-es/windows?r=1) is my primary OS, but I have a virtual machine running [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) to do fun tech things.

## Desktop Apps

- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) has revolutionized my studying.
- [Cold Turkey](https://getcoldturkey.com) has massively reduced my distractions and improved my productivity. My system is a pure Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V from Neel Nanda's post '[On Systems](https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-19-on-systems-living-a-life-of-zero-willpower).'

## Other

- [Ultraworking](https://www.ultraworking.com) (RIP) had a bunch of useful productivity tools.
