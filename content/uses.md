People sometimes ask me about the software/tools/tricks/stuff that I use. The idea of this uses page is to have a reference where you can read about all the stuff I use in my life.

### This website

- I used [Hugo blox](https://hugoblox.com) to make this website. It's a free open source website builder based on Markdown/HTML with some YAML. It's based on the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator.

## Editor + Terminal

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my current editor. 
- The [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com) is my main browser. It's quite big/heavy, but it has so many features ... :confounded face:
- [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/es-es/windows?r=1) is my OS, but I have a virtual machine running [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) to do fun tech things.

## Desktop Apps

- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) has revolutionised my studying
- [Cold turkey](https://getcoldturkey.com) has massively reduced my distractions and improved my productivity. My system is a pure  Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V from Neel Nanda's post '[On systems](https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-19-on-systems-living-a-life-of-zero-willpower)' post.

## Other

- [Ultraworking](https://www.ultraworking.com) (RIP) has a bunch of useful productivity tools.
